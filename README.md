> **The unwritten rule**
> 
> In men's public toilets with urinals, there is this unwritten rule that you leave at least one urinal free between you and
the next person peeing. For example if there are 3 urinals and one person is already peeing in the left one, you will
choose the urinal on the right and not the one in the middle. That means that a maximum of 3 people can pee at the
same time on public toilets with 5 urinals when following this rule (Only 2 if the first person pees into urinal 2 or 4).

The program aims to yield the maximum number of free urinals as an integer according to the unwritten rule.
